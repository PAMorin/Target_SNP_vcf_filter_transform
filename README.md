# Target_SNP_vcf_filter_transform
Scripts in R-markdown to transform vcf data for single SNPs into data for visualization and filtering prior to analysis. 
(based on harbor porpoise analysis in Morin et al. 2019: Data from the dead: genomic SNPs from poor-quality samples detect population structure in North Pacific harbor porpoise (manuscript in prep).
